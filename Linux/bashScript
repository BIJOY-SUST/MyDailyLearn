<-------- Shell Types -------->
- sh or Bourne Shell
- bash or Bourne Again shell
- csh or C shell
- tcsh or TENEX C shell
- ksh or the Korn shell

** /etc/shells gives an overview of known shells

<-------- Bash searches for commands as follows ------------>
- Check whether the command contains slashes. If not, first check with the function list
  to see if it contains a command by the name we are looking for.
- If command is not a function, check for it in the build-in list.
- If command is neither a function nor a build-in, look for it analyzing the directions listed in PATH.
  Bash users a 'hash table' (data storage area in memory) to remember the full path names of executables so extensive
  PATH searches can be avoided.
- If the search is unsuccessfull, bash prints an error message and returns an exit status of 127.
- If the search was seccessfull or if the command contains slashes, the shell executes the command in a
  separate execution environment.
- If execution fails because the file is not executable and not a directory, it is assumed to be a shell script.
- If the command was not begun asynchronously, the shell waits for the command to  complete and collects its exit status.
