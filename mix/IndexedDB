<------------------- What is IndexedDB ---------------------->
- IndexedDB is a way for you to persistently store data inside a user's browser.
Because it lets you create web applications with rich query abilities regardless of network availability,
your applications can work both online and offline.

<------------------- Basic Pattern ---------------->
The basic pattern that IndexedDB encourages is the following:

- Open a database.
- Create an object store in the database.
- Start a transaction and make a request to do some database operation, like adding or retrieving data.
- Wait for the operation to complete by listening to the right kind of DOM event.
- Do something with the results (which can be found on the request object).
