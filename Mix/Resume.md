#### Curriculam Vitae (CV)

- `Resume` comes from the French word résumé, meaning “summary.” A resume is a high-level summary of a person’s professional experience, education, certifications, and skills. It serves as a snapshot of a person’s professional experience.
- `CV` comes from the Latin phrase curriculum vitae, meaning “course of life.” A CV is a detailed collection of all of a person’s professional and educational experiences, accomplishments, and awards. It serves as a brief personal and professional biography. In the U.S., CVs are the most common documents in academia.

- Many applicants include a summary statement on their resumes. A summary statement is a few short sentences highlighting why you’re a valuable employee. A summary statement can be a powerful way to capitalize on the short time hiring managers spend on your resume by succinctly presenting your skills and passions. You can think of it as an attention-grabbing blurb, tag line, or hook.

- As you draft your summary statement, `be specific about your desired role`. Start your summary with a specific title like “City Planner,” “Administrative Professional,” or “Fundraising Specialist,” and follow it with no more than three sentences summing up your experience, skills, and goals. These sentences should describe what defines you as a professional in your field. 

- You can also use your summary to highlight your goals and demonstrate how you hope to work toward them in your next role.

For example, if you graduated with a degree in Computer Science and are applying for an IT help desk job, you could highlight that you enjoy using technology to improve others' lives.

#### Contact Information
Be sure to include your full name at the top of your resume. Even if you submit a resume through email, don’t assume 
someone will make a note of your email address. Have your phone number, professional email address, physical address, 
and website (or online portfolio link) front and center. Remember: you want to make it easy for potential employers to 
contact you.

#### Summary Statement
This statement `highlights your skills and experiences`. Typically found before your work experience and education, the summary
sets the stage for your accomplishments and highlights how you would `contribute to a potential employer’s organization`.

#### Work Experience
Think about the various jobs you’ve held. Ideally, you’ll have at least two to put on your resume and can list a `few bullet 
points` about each. For each job, `highlight any actionable, quantifiable responsibilities` you had and the key skills you used 
or developed. Every item you `describe should be in the past tense` except those related to your `current job`. Finally, keep 
your entries relevant to the role you’re applying for. This requires a bit of extra work, but candidates who tailor their 
resumes to specific positions are more successful job-hunters than those who send a generic resume as a part of all their 
applications.

#### Education
This section contains the `most recent educational institution(s)` you’ve attended, years of attendance, degree earned, and 
`relevant coursework`. If you are currently pursuing a degree, you can include that as well. As you begin your career, keep 
this section near the top. After you gain significant professional experience, it should fall `below Work Experience`.

#### Additional Skills
You may have `skills that do not fit neatly into any other section` on your resume. Maybe you are fluent in another language, or 
perhaps you have a relevant set of `awards or certifications`. Depending on the industry, having a separate 'Additional Skills' 
section `towards the bottom` that covers these abilities may prove helpful. For technical positions, this is where you 
should list your knowledge of `specific programming languages` or `software tools`.

#### Interests
Interest sections of resumes describe personal interests. They are an opportunity for hiring managers to relate to you 
on a personal level. You can include `sports`, `books`, `movies`, `cooking`, `traveling`, or any other (appropriate) 
hobby or personal interest. The more specific, the better!

### Formatting

- A well-formatted resume helps the hiring manager's eyes logically and consistently progress down the page.

#### Clear, Readable Font
Your `font choice` should be `professional` and `legible`. Remember, the literal translation of resume is `summary`. Use an `11- or 12`-point 
font; if you use anything smaller, people will be `squinting` to read it. Try `Calibri` or `Arial` as a standard typeface 
for a contemporary look and `Times New Roman` or another `serif` style for a `more traditional approach`.

#### Simple Headings
Each section should be `labeled clearly and professionally`. Although it may be tempting to label your work experience as 
something more creative, the classic `Work Experience` is a good option. If you want to `highlight` a specific type of 
experience like customer service, a label such as `Customer Service Experience` could also work. Just keep in mind that 
`simple headings make your resume more readable.

#### Succinct, Bulleted Task Lists
Breaking up long paragraphs with bullets calls out key points and makes your resume easier to read. `Work Experience` is 
likely to be your most content-heavy section, so you’ll want to use bulleted lists. They may also come in handy in your education 
section if you hold many degrees.

#### Consistent Margins
No matter what software program you choose to write your resume in, `remember to keep the margins consistent`. You want a balanced 
amount of white space, so try to `avoid overly narrow or wide margins`. It is standard practice to `keep resume margins to one inch`.

### Work Experience Bullets
For each job in our bullets, we should have `three` or `four` bullet points that highlights the most `interesting`, impressive, 
and relevant things we did in the position.

#### Focus on relevant responsibilities 
You won’t be able to list all of your job duties. Instead, focus on the `most impressive and relevant ones`. Highlight tasks that 
required a `high skill level` or `specialized knowledge` and any additional responsibilities you took on, such as `training 
other employees` or `managing large amounts of money`.

#### Begin bullet statements with verbs
Use a `variety of verbs` throughout your resume. For current jobs, use the `present tense`; all previous jobs should use the `past tense`.
Make sure these verbs are active. For example, `Processed` is a good way to start a bullet statement. On the other hand, 
`Was responsible for processing` is not active, so we shouldn’t use it. Some powerful verbs include:
     
     - Analyzed
     - Collaborated
     - Conducted
     - Controlled
     - Coordinated
     - Created
     - Designed
     - Developed
     - Established
     - Evaluated
     - Executed
     - Generated
     - Implemented
     - Improved
     - Increased
     - Launched
     - Led
     - Maximized
     - Organized
     - Prepared
     - Quantified
     - Reduced
     - Secured
     - Strengthened

#### Quantify your accomplishments
Each statement should also include numbers and time frames that quantify your impact and abilities. 'Processed cash and credit transactions' 
is not a bad bullet statement, but 'Processed up to $2,000 in cash and credit transactions daily' is much better. 
'Crafted and served up to 200 specialty coffee drinks per shift' is much more impressive than 'Served coffee.' 

#### Start strong
Remember that hiring managers typically read your resume in an `F` pattern, or by scanning down the left side of the page 
and following anything that looks interesting. To catch their eyes, make sure to lead your `bullet statements` with your 
most impressive accomplishments.
 
#### Do not embellish
`Overselling` your experiences may get you a lot of initial attention, but it will not pay off in the long term. If it appears 
you’ve `misrepresented` some or all of your qualifications, suspicious employers will either ignore your resume altogether or 
investigate your claims. Your `credibility and reputation suffer when you misrepresent yourself`.
