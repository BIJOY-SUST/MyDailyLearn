#### Explain Event Delegation
 Js event listeners fire not only a single DOM but on all it's descendants
 
#### Describe Event Bubbling ('bubble up')
 Also known as "propogation". Events on an element will "bubble up" and also fire on all parents.

#### Difference between `target` and `currentTarget`    
 `target` is actual thing what is clicked and `currentTarget` is where the event listener is attached to.
 
#### Explain why the following doesn't work as an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)
    function foo() {
        // code
    }();
    
Just put parentheses:      // JS interpretate everything what is in parentheses as
    
    ( function foo() {     // `expression` not a `statement`.
      //code               // So, it will run immediately
    } )();                 
 
#### Explain the difference on the usage of following -
  
  ```
  function foo() {
    // I am known as a definition or statement
  }
  ```
  
  ```
  var foo = function() {
    // i am an expression, i resolve to a value, even if just 'undefined'
    // expression = MDN - an expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value
  }
  ```
#### Explain `hoisting`
When you declare a variable in JavaScript (using "var"), that variable declaration is "hoisted" to the top of the
current scope: meaning the top of the current function or the top of the script if the variable isn't in a function.

#### Difference between a variable that is: null, undefined, or undeclared
- Undeclared: never used/defined before
  const bar = foo + 1;
  
  console.log(typeof bar); // undeclared, but also returns "undefined"
  
- Undefined:
    - variable declared but no defined value (not initialized)
    - object/array exists but nothing at that key/index
    - function exists but doesn't return anything
    - falsy
  
    let foo;
    const bar = foo;  // foo is undefined

    
    console.log(typeof foo); // "undefined" as a string
    console.log(foo === undefined) // true boolean
     
    const baz = 'undefined';
     console.log(baz === undefined); // false. Hooray, I guess
    
  
- null:
  - null has a value. It's value is null
  - null is a "nothing" value
  - not zero, not an empty string/object/array
  - falsy
  
  let foo = null;
  console.log(foo === null)  // true boolean
  
#### What is the output?

```js
var text = 'outside';
function logIt(){
    console.log(text);
    var text = 'inside';
};
logIt();
```
Answer: `undefined`
Explanation: variable declarations are "hoisted" to the top of the current scope. Variable assignments, however, are not.
- The code gets interpreted as though it were
```js                     | So, we have a new variable text inside of logIt() that is initialized to undefined,
  var text = 'outside';   | which is what it holds when we hit our log statement
function logIt(){         |
    var text;             |
    console.log(text);    |
    text = 'inside';      |
};                        |
logIt();                  |
```

#### How does `this` keyword change in different context?

`this` is a keyword whose value changes depending on how a function gets called. There `six` different ways where
`this` can take take new values. They are:

1. `this` in global context
2. `this` in object construction
3. `this` in an object method
4. `this` in a simple function
5. `this` in an arrow function
6. `this` in an event listener


1. **`This` In a Global Context**
When `this` is called outside of any function, in a global context, this defaults to the `window` object in the browser.

2. **`This` In Object Constructor**
When we create a new instance of an object with the `new` keyword, `this` refers to the instance.

```js
function Human(age) {
    this.age = age;
}

const alice = new Human(10);
const bob = new Human(20);

console.log(alice); // this.age = 10
console.log(bob); // this.age = 20
```

3. **`This` In An Object Method**
Methods are fancy words for functions that are associated with an object. e.g.

```js
const ob = {
    // A method
    sayThis() {
        console.log(this);
    }
}
ob.sayThis(); // ob
```

4. `This` In A Simple Function
Inside simple functions `this` refers to `Window`. Simple functions are functions we know extremely well. Anonymous functions written in the same form are also considered
simple functions.

```js
function simpleFunc() {
    console.log(this);  // Window
}

const o = {
    sayThis() {
        simpleFunc()
    }
}

simpleFunc();  // Window
o.sayThis();   // Window
```

Consider the following code.

```js
const o = {
    doSomethingLater() {
        setTimeout(function(){
           this.speakLeet();    // error
        }, 1000)
    }
    speakLeet() {
        console.log('Method of 'o' not Window');
    }
}
```
**Unfortunately**, the code above results in an error. The error occurs because `this` is set to `Window` in the `setTimeout`
methods. **`Window` does not have a `speakLeet` method**.

**Exception:** In strict mode, rules are different. Context remains as whatever it was set to. e.g.

**Another example:**

```js
function Counter() {
  this.num = 0;
  
  this.timer = setInterval(function add() {
    this.num++;
    console.log(this.num);
  }, 1000);
}

var b = new Counter();
// NaN
// NaN
// NaN
// ...
```
Our `setInterval` function is not called on a declared object. It also isn't being called with the `new` keyword (only the `Counter()` function is)
And lastly, we are not using `call`, `bind`, or `apply`. **setInterval** is just a normal function(). So, the value of
`this` is being bound to **global object**!

**N.B.** The arrow function does not create its own `this`, the `this` value of the enclosing execution context is used. Thus, in the
following code, the `this` within the function that is passed to `setInterval` has the same values as `this` in the enclosing function. 

**Solve the issue using Arrow function
```js
function Counter() {
  this.num = 0;
  
  this.timer = setInterval(() => {
    this.num++;
    console.log(this.num);
  }, 1000);
}

var b = new Counter();
// 1
// 2
// 3
// ...
```
The original `this` binding created by the `Counter` constructor function is preserved. Inside the `setInterval` function,
`this` is still bound to our newly created `b` object! 

```js
function f2 () {
  'use strict';
  
  return this;
}

console.log(f2() === window);     // False 
console.log(f2() === undefined);  // True
```

`this` was not defined, so it's remained **`undefined`**.

5. `This` is in Arrow Functions
In a arrow functions `this` is always the same as `this` around it (in its immediate scope, also called lexical scope).
So, the `this` context stays as the object, not `Window`.

With arrow functions, the `speakLeet` example above could be written:

```js
const o = {
    doSomethingLater() {
        setTimeout(() => this.speakLeet(), 1000);
    }
    speakLeet() {
        console.log('Method of 'o' not Window');
    }
}
```

**N.B:** We can also set `this` inside a method using `bind`, `call`, `apply`.

```js
var bar = 'bar of global';

var foo = {
  bar: 'bar of foo';
};
  
function f2() {
  return this.bar;
}
  
console.log(f2());             // bar of global
console.log(f2.call(foo));     // bar of foo
console.log(f2.apply());       // bar of foo


var bound = f2.bind(document)
var bound2 = f2.bind({ a: 15 });

console.log(bound());            // undefined, there is no variable in document object
console.log(bound.call(window)); // undefined, no variable in document object. In this situation, call can't change the context
console.log(bound2());           // 15, created a new object { a: 15 } and called f2() in this context        
```

**Exceptional:** Since `this` is not bound in arrow functions, the methods `call()` or `apply()` can only pass in parameters. **`this` is ignored**.

```js
var adder = {
  base: 1,

  add: function(a) {
    var f = v => v + this.base;

    return f(a);
  },

  addThroughCall: function(a) {
    var f = v => v + this.base;
    var b = {
      base: 2
    };

    return f.call(b, a);
  }
};
```
console.log(adder.add(1));  // output: 2
console.log(adder.addThruCall(1));  // output: 2


5. **This** In Event Listeners
`this`  is set the element that fired the event in an event listener.

```js
let button = document.querySelector('button');

button.addEventListener('click', function() {
    console.log(this)     // button
})
```

#### Convert a string to `spinal string`. Spinal string case is all-lowercase-words-joined-by-dashes.

Input:
This Is Spinal Tap
thisIsSpinalTap
The_Andy_Griffith_Show
Teletubbies say Eh-oh
AllThe-small Things

Output: 
this-is-spinal-tap
this-is-spinal-tap
the-andy-griffith-show
teletubbies-say-eh-oh
all-the-small-things


Solutions: 

```js
function spinalCase(str) {
  // Create a variable for the white space and underscores
  var regex = /\s+|_+/g
  
  // Replace low-upper case to low-space-uppercase
  str = str.replace(/([a-z])([A-Z])/g, '$1 $2');
  
  // Replace space and underscore with -
  return str.replace(regex, '-').toLowerCase();
}

// test here
spinalCase('This Is Spinal Tap');
```
